# Project Overview

This is a Restaurant Admin UI built with Next.js 15.5.3, featuring a comprehensive dashboard for restaurant management operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.3 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn-UI components
- **State Management**: React Context and custom stores
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control system
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack

# Goals

## Current Session Goal
Enhance the menu system to:
1. Display all available menu items instead of current limited selection
2. Implement role-based access control for menu items
3. Verify user roles and permissions before rendering menu items
4. Maintain security by hiding unauthorized options
5. Ensure responsive and user-friendly interface
6. Preserve existing functionality while expanding options

# Rules

- Always maintain type safety with TypeScript
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Ensure responsive design
- Maintain security best practices

# Current Progress
